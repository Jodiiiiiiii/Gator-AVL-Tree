# Gator-AVL-Tree
As a project for COP3530 Data Structures and Algorithms during Fall 2022, this project was a demonstration of my ability to create a custom self-balancing AVL tree data structure through direct manipulation of pointers in C++. Implemented operations included insertion, removal, searching, traversing, and branch rotation.
